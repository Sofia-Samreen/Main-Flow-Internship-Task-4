DATA ANALYSIS AND DATA SCIENCE WITH PYTHON TASK-4  
Task 4: Regression Analysis  

Objective: Build a regression model to predict house prices based on various features using linear regression.  
Steps to Complete the Project:   
1. Dataset Selection:  
● Dataset Name: house_prices.csv  
● Key Columns:  
○ Size: Numeric (e.g., in square feet).  
○ Location: Categorical (e.g., urban, suburban, rural).  
○ Number of Rooms: Numeric.  
○ Price: Numeric (target variable).  
2. Tasks to Perform:    
    1. Load and Explore  
● Inspect the Dataset:   
○ Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.   
○ Analyze distributions of numerical variables (e.g., Size, Price).  
○ Identify potential outliers that might skew results.  
    2. Data Preprocessing  
● Normalize Numerical Data:  
○ Scale features like Size and Number of Rooms to bring them to a comparable range using methods like Min-Max Scaling or Standardization.  
● Encode Categorical Features:  
○ Convert Location into numerical values using methods such as:  
■ One-Hot Encoding for non-ordinal categories.  
■ Label Encoding for ordinal categories (if any).   
    3. Feature Selection  
● Analyze Predictors:  
○ Use correlation analysis to identify relationships between features and the target variable (Price).  
○ Consider removing low-impact predictors to improve model performance.  
    4. Model Training  
● Train-Test Split:   
○ Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test). Ensure the split is random but reproducible.  
● Train a Linear Regression Model:  
○ Use libraries like scikit-learn or similar tools to fit the regression model.  
    5. Model Evaluation  
● Evaluation Metrics:   
○ Calculate Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy.  
○ Determine R² (Coefficient of Determination) to evaluate how well the model explains variability in the data.

3. Deliverables:    
   1. Trained Regression Model:  
○ A fitted linear regression model capable of predicting house prices.  
   2. Predictions:  
○ Outputs for the test data including predicted vs. actual prices.  
   3. Evaluation Metrics:  
○ RMSE and R² values for model performance.  
   4. Feature Insights:  
○ Summary of the most important predictors influencing house prices.
